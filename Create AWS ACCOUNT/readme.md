# Creating a Free-Tier AWS Account: A Step-by-Step Guide
This is your first step in the world of AWS cloud computing! This is a walk through of creating a free-tier Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. This gives access to a wide range of services for 12 months, which is ample time to learn and experiment without any cost.

## Prerequisites

Just before any progress is made, the following are requirements to proceed. Get ready with me.

1. A Valid Email Address: serving as the root email address.

2. A Valid Mobile Number: will be required later on for verification.

3. Credit/Debit Card details: although this is a free tier account, AWS requires a valid payment method to verify your identity and for any usage that exceeds the free tier limits. You will not be charged for free-tier usage.

4. Unique Account Name: something easy to remember and also represents the purpose of your account (e.g., "my-personal-dev-account").

## Getting to business

Step 1: Open your web browser search for AWS free tier or go to the official AWS Free Tier page: https://aws.amazon.com/free/.

Step 2: Click the "Create a Free Account" button.

Step 3: Enter Your Account Information
You will be redirected to the sign-up page. Follow the instructions to fill out your details:

* Email Address: Enter your email address. This will be the root user email for your account.

* Account Name: Enter the account name your choosing.

* Verify Email Address: AWS will send a verification code to your email. Enter this code to proceed.

* Create a Password: Ensure this is  a strong password for your root user. This is the most powerful user in your account, so make it secure! I always recommend using password managers for this purpose (Bitwarden etc)

Step 4: Add Your Contact Information
Provide your personal contact details, including your full name, phone number, and address. This information is used for account verification and billing purposes. Select "Personal" for the account type.

Step 5: Enter Billing Information
On the billing information page, enter your credit or debit card details. Remember, you will not be charged for services used within the free tier limits. This information is a security measure to prevent fraudulent sign-ups and to process payments if you exceed the free tier.

Step 6: Identity Verification
To complete the sign-up, AWS will perform an identity verification. This usually involves a phone call or a text message to the number you provided. You will be asked to enter a code from the call or message to confirm your identity.

Step 7: Select a Support Plan
You will be asked to choose a support plan. Select the "Basic Support - Free" plan. This plan is free of charge and is all you need for your learning journey.

Step 8: Complete Sign-Up
After choosing your support plan, you will see a confirmation page. Click "Complete sign up." You will then be redirected to the AWS Management Console.

## Best Practices
Yeey, your account is now ready! Tips to follow for a secure and cost-effective experience:

Create an IAM User: Do not use your root account for daily tasks. Immediately create an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user with administrative privileges and use that for your work. Your root account should only be used for account-level management tasks.

Set Up a Billing Alarm: To avoid unexpected charges, set up a billing alarm that will notify you via email when your account spending reaches a certain threshold. You can set this to a very low amount (e.g., $1) to be safe.

Monitor Usage: Regularly check the AWS Billing Dashboard to monitor your usage and ensure you are staying within the free tier limits.

Clean Up Resources: When you're finished experimenting with a service, remember to shut down or delete any resources you created (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets) to prevent them from incurring charges.


Congratulations! You are now set up to begin your cloud journey with AWS.
