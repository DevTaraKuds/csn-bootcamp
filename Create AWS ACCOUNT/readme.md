# Creating a Free-Tier AWS Account: A Step-by-Step Guide
This is your first step in the world of AWS cloud computing! This is a walk through of creating a free-tier Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. This gives access to a wide range of services for 12 months, which is ample time to learn and experiment without any cost.

## Prerequisites

Just before any progress is made, the following are requirements to proceed. Get ready with me.

1. A Valid Email Address: serving as the root email address.

2. A Valid Mobile Number: will be required later on for verification.

3. Credit/Debit Card details: although this is a free tier account, AWS requires a valid payment method to verify your identity and for any usage that exceeds the free tier limits. You will not be charged for free-tier usage.

4. Unique Account Name: something easy to remember and also represents the purpose of your account (e.g., "my-personal-dev-account").
